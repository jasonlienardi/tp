## Design & implementation

### Architecture

The architecture diagram belows shows the overall design of our FitNUS CLI app and how each component interact with each other.

![Architecture Diagram](../docs/diagrams/diagrams_png/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

**Main Components of The Architecture**

- `FitNUS`: FitNUS main code which runs the program until termination
- `Ui`: The user interface of the app that reads in user input
- `Storage`: Handles storage of all `meal`, `drink` and `exercise` that the user has input
- `Parser`: Parses user input
- `User`: Handles user input and stores the `Exercise`, `Drink`, `Meal`, and `Water` created by user
- `Date`: Handles user's local machine date
- `ExerciseList`: Exercises completed and its duration created by user
- `DrinkList`: Drinks intake (including water) and its nutritional values created by user
- `MealList`: Meals intake and its nutritional values created by user

### Ui Component
#### Sequence Diagram
_Note: The following sequence diagram captures the interactions only between the Fitnus, Ui and Parser classes_

![Ui Sequence Diagram](../docs/diagrams/diagrams_png/ParserSequenceDiagram.png)         

When the user first starts the application, the Ui class will be constructed. Within the Ui class, Scanner and Parser 
similarly will be constructed.

The Ui class will continuously read the user input:
- If the user input DOES NOT correspond to "exit", Ui will pass the user input to Parser class. Parser class will both 
  parse and handle the command.
- Else if the user input corresponds to "exit", Ui will handle the exit.

### Storage Component
#### Description
The Ui component will create a `StorageManager` to manage the reading and writing of the `Storage` (meal, drink, and exercise).
There are two types of data being stored, one to keep track of what the user has inputted to the app, and one to keep track
of the nutritional information of the known meal/drinks/exercise.

#### Implementation
- File Location:
  - The user's meal, drinks, and exercise data is stored into text files in 
  `./data/MealList.txt`, `./data/DrinkList.txt`, and `./data/ExerciseList.txt`, respectively. 
  - The nutritional information of all available meals, drinks, and exercises is stored into csv files in
  `./db/Meal_db.csv`, `./db/Drink_db.csv`, `./db/Exercise_db.csv`, respectively.
- Format:
  - All `Meal` objects in `MealList` will be formatted and stored in a string format of "`MEAL_NAME`,`SERVING_SIZE`,`DATE`"
  - All `Drink` objects in `DrinkList` will be formatted and stored in a string format of "`DRINK_NAME`,`SERVING_VOLUME`,`DATE`"
  - All `Exercise` objects in `ExerciseList` will be formatted and stored in a string format of "`EXERCISE_NAME`,`DURATION`,`INTENSITY`,`DATE`"
  - All meal nutrients are stored in the format of "`MEAL_NAME`,`CALORIES`,`CARBS`,`PROTEIN`,`FAT`,`FIBER`,`SUGAR`"
  - All drink nutrients are stored in the format of "`DRINK_NAME`,`CALORIES`,`CARBS`,`SUGAR`,`PROTEIN`,`FAT`"
  - All exercise information is stored in the format of "`EXERCISE_NAME`,`HIGH_INTENSITY`,`MEDIUM_INTENSITY`,`LOW_INTENSITY`"
- Loading: When the app starts, the `StorageManager` will load and parse all the nutrient information from the csv files and put it into 
a HashMap in the `Meal`, `Drink`, and `Exercise` class. However, if the csv files are not found, it will create a new csv file
and store some pre-defined contents. Then, `StorageManager` will load and parse all the user data from the txt files and append it
into list in the `MealList`, `DrinkList`, and `ExerciseList`. If the txt files are not found, it will create a new txt file.
- Writing: When the user enter the `exit` command, the `StorageManager` will retrieve all the `Meal`, `Drink`, and `Exercise` objects
from the list and format it into string. Then, it will append all the strings and write the files to the corresponding `Storage`.

#### Sequence Diagram
_Note: The following sequence diagram captures the interactions only between the Ui, Storage and StorageManager 
classes when loading and saving data.  
XYZ is used as a placeholder for Meal / Drink / Exercise for diagram simplicity._ 

![Storage Sequence Diagram](../docs/diagrams/diagrams_png/StorageManagerSequenceDiagram.png)

### User Component
#### Description
The User component will create MealList, DrinkList and ExerciseList for the user to track their data. Additionally, 
this component is in-charge of handling view, listEverything, recommend and clear commands.

#### Implementation
User Class:
- Attributes:
  - `myMealList:` Represents the user's class that managers the meal lists.
  - `myDrinkList:` Represents the user's class that managers the drink lists.
  - `myExerciseList:` Represents the user's class that managers the exercise lists.


- Methods:
  - `handleViewCalories()`: Prints the user's net calorie intake of the day.
  - `handleViewCarbohydrates()`: Prints the user's total carbohydrates intake of the day.
  - `handleViewProteins()`: Prints the user's total protein intake of the day.
  - `handleViewFiber()`: Prints the user's total fiber intake of the day.
  - `handleViewFat()`: Prints the user's total fat intake of the day.
  - `handleViewSugar()`: Prints the user's total sugar intake of the day.
  - `handleListEverything()`: Prints all meals and drinks that the user has inputted today.
  - `handleListEverythingAll()`: Prints all meals and drinks that the user has inputted of all-time.
  - `handleListEverythingDate()`: Prints all meals and drinks that the user has inputted on a specified date.
  - `handleClear()`: Clears all user's entries of the day.
  - `handleRecommendations()`: Give recommendations to the user based on their calorie and water intake.

#### Sequence Diagram
_Note: The following sequence diagram captures the interactions only between the User, MealList, DrinkList and 
ExerciseList classes._   

For diagram simplicity, the following choices were made when creating the diagram:
- Only optional blocks for handleViewXYZ() and handleClear() methods were created.   
  As such, methods within User such as 
  handleRecommendations() and handleListEverything()  were omitted.
- For methods where the user would like to view their nutrional content (handleViewXYZ), XYZ is used as a placeholder 
  for the specified nutritional content (e.g. calories, carbohydrates, protein etc.)

![User Class Diagram](../docs/diagrams/diagrams_png/UserSequenceDiagram.png)

User class initialises MealList, DrinkList and ExerciseList for the user to track their data.

### Exercise Component
![Exercise Class Diagram](../docs/diagrams/diagrams_png/ExerciseListClassDiagram.png)

1. Upon starting up the application, User will call `loadExercise` to fetch all data from `ExerciseList.txt` and add it into `exerciseListAll`.
2. A `User` class consists of zero to as many `Exercise` objects in the ArrayList.
3. Each `Exercise` contains exactly one enumeration of `ExerciseIntensity`.
### Drink Component
![Drink Class Diagram](../docs/diagrams/diagrams_png/DrinkListClassDiagram.png)

1. Upon starting up the application, User will call `loadDrink` to fetch all data from `DrinkList.txt` and add it into `drinkListAll`.
2. A `User` class consists of zero to as many `Drink` objects in the ArrayList and zero to as many `Water` objects in the ArrayList.
### Meal Component
![Meal Class Diagram](../docs/diagrams/diagrams_png/MealListClassDiagram.png)

1. Upon starting up the application, User will call `loadMeal` to fetch all data from `Mealist.txt` and add it into `mealListAll`.
2. A `User` class consists of zero to as many `Meal` objects in the ArrayList.
## Implementation

### Information on a Particular Meal Feature
The `infoMeal` feature is executed on the `User` class. Let's say we want to find out about the nutrient values of chicken rice.   
**Sample Input**: `infoMeal chicken rice`

![InfoMeal Sequence Diagram](../docs/diagrams/diagrams_png/InfoMealSequenceDiagram.png)

### Eat Command
The `eat` command is responsible for handling the tracking of meal and adding it to the Meal List. 
The following sequence diagram shows the execution of the `eat` command.

![Eat Command Sequence Diagram](../docs/diagrams/diagrams_png/EatCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

1. The user inputs an `eat` command of the format `eat m/MEAL s/SERVING_SIZE` into the `ui` object
2. The `ui` object calls the `parseCommand()` method of the `parser` object
3. The parser parses the command and calls the appropriate method, which in this case is `handleMeal()` of `MealList`
4. The `MealList` object then calls the `parseMeal` method to retrieve the information from the command such as the meal name and serving size
5. With the meal details retrieved from the parser, a new `Meal` object with the given parameters (meal name, serving size) is created and returned to `MealList`
6. When creating a new `Meal` object, it will call its own method `setNutrientDetails()` to set the nutrients for that specific meal using the meal name
7. The newly created `Meal` object is then added to the `MealList`
8. Upon successful tracking of a meal a confirmation message is printed

Note: The implementation for `drink` and `exercise` command have similar sequence diagrams

### Edit Meal Command
The `editMeal` command allows users to edit the serving sizes of their meals that have already been added to the Meal List.
The following sequence diagram shows the execution of the `editMeal` command.

![Edit Meal Command Sequence Diagram](../docs/diagrams/diagrams_png/EditMealCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

1. The user inputs an `editMeal` command of the format `editMeal INDEX s/NEW_SERVING_SIZE` into the `ui` object
2. The `ui` object calls the `parseCommand()` method of the `parser` object
3. The parser parses the command and calls the appropriate method, which in this case is `handleEditMealServingSize()` of `MealList`
4. The `MealList` object then calls the `parseEditMeal` method to retrieve the information from the command such as the intended meal index and current serving size
5. With the meal name and current serving size retrieved, the `Meallist` objects retrieves the name and nutrient details of the meal by calling the `getName()` and `getData()` methods of the `Meal` object
6. A new `Meal` object with the updated serving size is created and returned to `MealList`
7. The newly created `Meal` object is then replaces the meal at the specified position in this list by calling the `set()` method of `MealList`
8. Upon successful tracking of a meal a confirmation message is printed

Note: The implementation for `editDrink` and `editWater` command have similar sequence diagrams

### New Meal Command
The `newMeal` command allows users to add new meal to the list of available meals by specifying the meal name and its nutrients.
The following sequence diagram shows the execution of the `newMeal` command.

![New Meal Command Sequence Diagram](../docs/diagrams/diagrams_png/NewMealCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

1. The user inputs an `newMeal` command of the format `newMeal MEAL_NAME,CALORIES,CARBS,PROTEIN,FAT,FIBER,SUGAR` into the `ui` object
2. The `ui` object calls the `parseCommand()` method of the `parser` object
3. The parser parses the command and calls the appropriate method, which in this case is `handleAddNewMealNutrient()` of `MealList`
4. The `MealList` object then calls the `parseNewMeal` method to retrieve the information from the command such as the mean name, calories, carbs, protein, fat, fiber and sugar
5. The Nutrient of the details are then stored in the `nutrientDetails` hashmap attribute of the `Meals` class using the `put()` method of the hashmap
6. Upon successful tracking of a meal a confirmation message is printed

Note: The implementation for `newDrink` and `newExercise` command have similar sequence diagrams

## Product scope
### Target user profile
- Have a need to manage their dietary intake and exercise routines effectively.
- Prefer desktop applications over other types of platforms.
- Can type quickly and prefer typing over mouse interactions.
- Are reasonably comfortable using command-line interface (CLI) applications.

### Value proposition

The fitness app aims to help users manage their dietary habits and exercise routines more efficiently compared to traditional GUI-driven apps. 
By offering a streamlined interface optimized for keyboard input and CLI interactions, users can track their meals, drinks, and exercises swiftly, allowing them to focus more on their fitness and nutritional goals and less on navigating through complex user interfaces.
