## 3) FAQ
**Q**: How do I save changes made in the app? 

**A**: All changes will be saved once typing `exit` and terminating the program correctly. Any abrupt termination will 
cause all changes within the session to be lost.

**Q**: What is the difference between `listMeals` and `listMealsAll`?

**A**: `listMeals` will list out all the meals you have eaten today 
(with respect to the device current date). Let's say you type `listMeals` on Monday 23:59, 
and then type it again on Tuesday 00:01, the list displayed will be different (empty if you have not made any changes). 
`listMealsAll` will list out all the meals you have eaten throughout the lifetime of the app, it could be days ago,
weeks ago, months, or even years, as long ss you have inputted and saved it correctly and did not delete the data. 
The same applies for others (e.g. `listDrinks` and `listDrinksAll`)

**Q**: Will `clear` erase all the entries from days ago?

**A**: No. `clear` will only delete all insertions (including post edit) you have made today.

**Q**: Am I able to delete or edit the entries I have inserted from days ago?

**A**: No. All drinks, meals, and exercises, you have inserted from days ago will no longer be able to change. 
Only changes made today can be edited/deleted, so make sure that everything is correct before the date changes!

**Q**: My `listDrinks` have 3 indexes, but my `listDrinksAll` have 10 indexes, why can't I perform `deleteDrink 10`?

**A**: Referring to the previous question, you can only delete/edit items made today. `listDrinks` and `listDrinksAll` 
have different list indexes, please follow `listDrinks` index only. This applies to both meal and exercises.
